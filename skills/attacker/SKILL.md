# attacker

Attack a product's observable behavior with everything you've got, then record
the attacks that **succeeded** — proven, reproducible breakages — so a later
round can fix them. The deliverable is a set of **attack records** (a handoff
document set), each a runnable repro plus `observed != expected` — never a fix,
never edits to the target, never a passing test suite.

The defect this skill targets is the **false-positive test suite**: a green TDD
suite on top of a broken product. The cause is **correlated error** — a test, a
mock, an "expected" fixture, even the author's framing, produced from the *same
mental model* as the impl, inherits that model's misread. The only fix is
**engineered independence** (Knight–Leveson: the specification is the dominant
common-mode channel). So the attacker runs from a context that never saw the
impl, the tests, or the author's framing. **Independence is the entire value
proposition — every other choice is downstream of protecting it.**

## Preflight (CONTEXT-gate → scope → mode → MODE-altitude → budget)

0. **CONTEXT — a HARD GATE (do this FIRST — load `references/context-intake.md`).** Take in a
   rich context bundle: the **target** (product OR idea) + its **type**, the **claim /
   requirement**, **constraints**, **success criteria**, **what counts as a real break**,
   the **in/out-of-scope** domains, and **prior rounds**. **The attacker MUST NOT attack until
   (a) SCOPE is clear (`in_scope` declared and specific) AND (b) CONTEXT is sufficient.** If
   insufficient: first **ASK the user** (prompt for the missing specifics — the more precise
   the context, the sharper the attack); if still thin, **SELF-RESEARCH the project** to
   establish scope / attack surface / structure (the WHAT). Record where the round's context
   came from in **`summary.context_sources`** (≥1 strings, e.g. `"user-provided"`,
   `"self-researched: surface map"`). **Self-research is independence-safe:** for **debug** you
   may map the surface/requirement but still derive EXPECTATIONS from the requirement, NOT from
   reading impl internals (don't re-contaminate debug expectations); for **structural** reading
   the structure is expected and fine. Product debug still excludes impl/tests/author framing;
   idea takes the claim but critiques it **independently**. Optionally also record a one-line
   `summary.context_digest`.
1. **Scope (the ATTACK-SCOPE CONTRACT).** Declare WHICH domains/layers are attacked:
   - **`--scope <descriptor>…`** → `summary.in_scope` (≥1 RICH free-form descriptors, e.g.
     "UI rendering errors", "page navigation/logic transitions") — the only domains a
     finding may target. Every confirmed record tags its **`attack_scope`** (one of these).
   - **`--out-of-scope <descriptor>…`** → `summary.out_of_scope` (may be empty) — declared
     exclusions. An observation found OUTSIDE scope goes in the **top-level `out_of_scope[]`**
     bucket: **kept, but NOT counted as a finding and NOT gated**. ("Attack the UI" → hits
     UI rendering + page navigation, NOT backend logic.)
   - Also resolve **`--target <module/feature|idea>`** and **`--round N`**.
2. **Mode — `target.type` (`product` | `idea`).** **product** = a running feature
   (the v0.1–0.2 path: product oracles + the impl/TDD firewall + a real seam). **idea** =
   an argument/design/plan (debate con-side): the proof shape is **claim + observed≠expected
   + reasoning chain + minimal scenario + `not_strawman` + an idea oracle + a critique
   derived independently** — SAME loop/round-verdict/budget/carry-forward, only the oracle +
   proof shape change. The validator gates each record by its mode (see `references/oracle-menu.md`).
2b. **Attack MODE — `summary.attack_mode` (`debug` | `structural` | `both`).** A SECOND, orthogonal
   axis (the round's ALTITUDE), set per round and required on the summary:
   - **`debug`** = a concrete behavioral bug-hunt (the existing flow). Records are `attack_kind:"debug"`.
   - **`structural`** = interrogate the project's **LOGIC/ARCHITECTURE** — design problems, coupling,
     logic-flow, missing/leaky abstractions, inconsistent patterns — higher altitude. Records are
     `attack_kind:"structural"`: you MUST be allowed to **SEE the structure** to critique it, so
     structural records DROP impl-withholding + `real_collaborator_at_seam` and instead REQUIRE a
     **`critique_basis`** (the external design principle OR stated goal violated) + `observed≠expected`
     + `derived_independently:true` + a **STRUCTURAL oracle** (`references/oracle-menu.md` §S).
   - **`both`** = do **STRUCTURAL FIRST, then debug** (a protocol discipline; the validator only
     enforces that each record's `attack_kind` is permitted by the mode: `debug`→only debug,
     `structural`→only structural, `both`→either).
2c. **Scope stability + depth.** Set **`summary.scope_change`** (`initial` | `stable` | `expanded` |
   `narrowed`) — each round stays stable OR expands **incrementally** (never a wild jump) — and
   **`summary.depth`** (int ≥ 1, the progressive-deepening level within the scope; see Regression).
3. **Dual hard budget** (MANDATORY — the round is HARD-BOUNDED, no endless attack):
   - **`--budget N`** — attempts cap (rolled up as `ASR@n`). **Default ≈ 12** if unset.
   - **`--max-tokens T`** — per-round token-consumption cap (NOT wall-clock time). **Default ≈ 60k** if unset.
   - **`--max-context T`** *(v0.3.2, soft)* — a **loose** cap (**≈ 30k** default) on CONTEXT intake +
     self-research: stay **scope-relevant**, do NOT slurp the whole repo. Loose by design — a rough
     ceiling so context/cost don't balloon, not a hard gate.
   The round stops at **whichever cap hits first**, in **exhaust-budget mode** (one
   round reports ALL proven breaks for a batch fix — NOT stop-on-first). **Speed (v0.3.2):** attack
   cheapest-highest-impact first, and you MAY **early-exit** once the declared scope is adequately
   covered within budget — don't burn the full budget if the scope is already covered. Never
   default to unbounded crawling — a run is cheap and re-runnable per feature.
4. Locate/create the **target project's** `.loop/` for `attack-records.jsonl` +
   the battery ledger (project-local, NOT under the skill dir).
5. **Round 1 → cold start** (`carried_from_round:null`). **Round>1 → CARRY-FORWARD:**
   load this skill's OWN prior attack ledger from `<project>/.loop/` (surface map +
   attempted-attacks + confirmed/fixed records by `regression_key`) and re-derive only
   **NEW** surface — do NOT re-plan from scratch (re-deriving the whole attack plan each
   round is token waste). Record which prior round you inherited as `carried_from_round`.
   Still **NOT** loaded (product mode): impl source / TDD suite / author framing
   (independence preserved).

## Round verdict (the loop's STOP-CONDITION)

Each round emits a machine-readable **`round_verdict`** (`broke` | `clean` |
`inconclusive`) + **`stop_reason`** (`plan_complete` | `budget_exhausted`) on the
summary the LOOP branches on:
- **`clean`** (no proven break, plan ran to completion) → the loop's **done/converged**
  signal → **STOP**. Honest caveat: `clean` ≠ proven correct; it is "no proven break
  within budget B."
- **`broke`** (≥1 proven break) → route to a **fix round**, then **re-attack**.
- **`inconclusive`** (a budget cap hit, nothing found — NOT proven correct) → a
  **qualified stop the loop owner decides on**.

## The attack round — spawn a FRESH subagent (load references/attack-process.md)

Spawn the attack as a **fresh, isolated subagent**. Hand it a **curated context
bundle of ONLY**: (a) the requirement / intended behavior, and (b) the target's
observable behavior (invoke + observe + baseline — the target-adapter contract).
**Do NOT pass** implementation source, the TDD/unit suite, or author framing into
its window. Enforcement (Q1): a new subagent starts with an empty context window;
the only project content it sees is what your spawn prompt includes — so the
withholding is a property of what you choose to include, audited per record by
`independence_attestation.withheld` (the validator REJECTS a confirmed record
whose `withheld` omits `implementation_source` or `tdd_suite`). If the same model
wrote the target, route verification to a **separate** fresh checker instance
(generator ≠ judge).

Inside the subagent run **READ → DESIGN → EXECUTE → PROVE → RECORD**:

1. **READ** — map the attack surface from observable behavior (not source);
   derive intended behavior independently from the requirement; measure a
   steady-state **baseline**. No baseline ⇒ `needs_instrumentation` →
   `needs_judgment`, never a guess.
2. **DESIGN** — **reuse the inherited ledger first** (round>1): skip/deprioritize
   already-tried low-yield attacks, spend fresh budget on NEW surface + unconfirmed
   leads. Then derive attacks via spec-inversion + STRIDE breadth + the business-logic
   abuse catalog from `assets/payload-library.json`; build a small attack tree tagged
   cost/likelihood/prereq; attack cheapest-highest-impact first.
3. **EXECUTE** — frame each as a falsifiable experiment scoped to the smallest
   unit; **blast-radius control** + staged escalation + abort/stop conditions;
   **debug/product:** attack **real seams (no mocks)** where the attack lands; **idea:** run
   the reasoning over the **minimal scenario/case**; **structural:** trace the structure/logic
   itself (reading it is expected). In **`both`** mode do the **structural pass FIRST**, then
   debug. **Stop at whichever hard cap hits first — `--budget N` (attempts) OR `--max-tokens T`
   (tokens)** — exhaust-budget mode (report ALL breaks, not first-break).
4. **PROVE** — pick from the **mode-appropriate** ranked **oracle menu**
   (`references/oracle-menu.md`): **product** oracles (implicit→differential→metamorphic→
   control→specified), **idea** oracles (counterexample / contradiction / unmet_assumption /
   scope_violation / infeasibility / missing_case), or **structural** oracles (the idea oracles
   that fit design critique + specified — §S). State which fired; confirm `observed != expected`
   (idea: `expected`=what the claim predicts; structural: `expected`=what good structure / the
   stated goal requires); shrink to a 1-minimal reproducer / minimal scenario; **re-run it** (a
   fresh reader re-checks the reasoning) to confirm it still fails (`repro.replayed_ok`).
5. **RECORD** — one record per **proven** defect → `records[]`; unprovable / vague →
   `needs_judgment[]`; out-of-scope discovery → `out_of_scope[]` (kept, not counted). Tag
   each record's **`attack_scope`** (∈ `summary.in_scope`) and its **`attack_kind`**
   (`debug` | `structural`, permitted by `summary.attack_mode`); compute `regression_key`,
   dedup, roll up `ASR@n` + unique-finding count + severity histogram **+ the round
   verdict** (`round_verdict` + `stop_reason` + `tokens_used`/`max_tokens` +
   `carried_from_round`) **+ the v0.3.1 fields** (`attack_mode` + `context_sources` +
   `scope_change` + `depth`). **debug/idea** records carry `claim` + `not_strawman` +
   `derived_independently`; **debug/product** records carry `real_collaborator_at_seam` +
   `withheld ⊇ {implementation_source, tdd_suite}`; **structural** records carry
   `critique_basis` + `derived_independently:true` (NO withheld/seam — you may see the structure).

## Regression → context-fill → DEEPEN (start of each new round)

Round > 1 follows a fixed sequence (the same carry-forward ledger as v0.2.0, now with an
explicit order):
1. **Regression FIRST** — re-run every prior record's repro by `regression_key`: now-passing →
   `status:"fixed"`; still-failing → stays `confirmed` and **blocks**.
2. **Use that resolution to FILL context** — what's fixed / still-broken feeds THIS round's
   context (record it in `summary.context_sources`).
3. **Then go DEEPER** — increment `summary.depth`, attack **within scope at greater depth** /
   incremental new surface (`scope_change:"expanded"` if surface grows). **NEVER restart from
   scratch** (cold-restarting wastes tokens). Monotonic depth across rounds is a discipline; the
   validator only checks `depth ≥ 1`.

## Verify (the round's gate — feedback_signal.check)

```bash
node scripts/validate_attack_records.mjs <project>/.loop/attack-records.jsonl
node evals/run_all.mjs        # validator unit cases + the non-vacuity self-test
```
The round is done only when the validator is green **AND** the non-vacuity
self-test passes **AND** a fresh-context checker re-reads the records cold,
re-runs the repros, and signs `assets/fresh-reader-checklist.md` (maker ≠ checker).

## Report

The attack-records document set + roll-up (template `assets/attack-record.template.md`)
become the next round's fix list. **Attacker NEVER edits the target.**

## Controls (externalized — not prose "be careful")

- **Never edit the target.** Output is a handoff document set only; a separate fix
  round repairs (detect-vs-remediate boundary).
- **PROVE-OR-FLAG / REPRODUCIBLE-OR-DROP** — enforced by
  `scripts/validate_attack_records.mjs` (the §5 gate), **conditional on `attack_kind` then
  `target.type`**: every confirmed record needs observed≠expected, a non-empty repro +
  `minimized_input`, `repro.replayed_ok:true`, a **kind-appropriate** named oracle,
  `non_tautology_check`, a non-empty **`attack_scope` ∈ `summary.in_scope`**, and an
  **`attack_kind`** the round's `summary.attack_mode` permits (debug→debug, structural→structural,
  both→either — REJECT otherwise). **debug/product** additionally requires
  `real_collaborator_at_seam:true` + `withheld ⊇ {implementation_source, tdd_suite}`;
  **debug/idea** additionally requires `claim` + `not_strawman:true` + `derived_independently:true`;
  **structural** additionally requires `critique_basis` + `derived_independently:true` + a
  **structural oracle** (and DROPS withheld/seam — a product behavioral oracle on a structural
  record is REJECTED). Unprovable / vague → `needs_judgment`.
- **Mandatory context + self-research** — the attacker MUST NOT attack until scope is clear AND
  context is sufficient; `summary.context_sources` (≥1) attests where the round's context came from
  (user-provided / self-researched). `summary.attack_mode`, `scope_change`, and `depth` are required
  on a user-supplied summary (validator-enforced).
- **Attack-scope contract** — `summary.in_scope` (≥1 descriptors) + `out_of_scope`
  declare WHICH domains are attacked; a confirmed record whose `attack_scope` is empty or
  not in `in_scope` is REJECTED; out-of-scope observations live in the top-level
  `out_of_scope[]` (kept, never counted as findings).
- **Anti-vacuity** — a correctly-rejected malformed input the contract never
  promised to handle (product), or a vague "I disagree" with no concrete counter
  (idea), is NOT a finding (validator rejects it in `records[]`).
- **Blast-radius / budget / abort** — smallest-unit scope, declared per record,
  staged escalation, `--budget` cap (rolled up as `ASR@n`), abort conditions.
- **Non-vacuity self-test** — `evals/run_all.mjs` runs a planted-bug fixture the
  validator MUST flag and a clean-control that MUST yield zero findings.
- **Hardened** — `scripts/check_battery_clean.mjs` (≥N consecutive clean rounds,
  unique context per round); `scripts/check_release_gate.mjs` binds "industrial".

## Loop integration + metrics

attacker is a **sub-loop NODE**, not the loop owner: loop-constructor designs the
loop and emits the `.loop/` runbook, **maker–checker is mandatory**, and attacker is
the loop's **`feedback_signal.check`** / **STOP-CONDITION**: `A→B→C→attack`; a `clean`
attack pass is the loop's *converged* signal (STOP), `broke` routes to a fix round then
re-attack, `inconclusive` (budget hit, nothing found) is a qualified stop the loop owner
decides. Rounds alternate attacker → fixer → fresh attacker (regression by
`regression_key`, then new surface, **carrying forward the prior attack ledger** so the
plan is never re-derived from scratch). Round success = validator green AND fresh-checker
re-confirmed AND non-vacuity self-test green. For the full round-alternation diagram, the
dual budget, the carry-forward ledger, and the metric definitions (`ASR@n`, severity
histogram, the must-be-zero false-negative / false-positive invariants), load
`rules/loop-and-metrics.md`.
